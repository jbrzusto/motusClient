#' @details Implementation details:
#'
#' For both tags and receivers, deployment meta-data has to be looked
#' up by detection ("hit") timestamp; i.e. we need the latest
#' deployment record which is still before the hit timestamp.  So we
#' are joining the hit table to the deployment table by a timestamp on
#' the hit and a greatest lower bound for that timestamp in the
#' deployment table.  It would be nice if there were an SQL
#' "LOWER JOIN" operator, which instead of joining on exact key value,
#' would join a key on the left to its greatest lower bound on the
#' right.  (and similary, an "UPPER JOIN" operator to bind to the
#' least upper bound on the right.)  For keys with B-tree indexes,
#' this would be as fast as an exact join.
#'
#' We can instead code this as a subquery like so:
#'
#' CREATE TABLE hits (ts double, tagID integer);
#' CREATE TABLE tagDeps (tsStart double, tsEnd double, tagID integer, info char);
#'
#'    SELECT t1.*, t2.info from hits as t1 left join tagDeps as t2 on
#'    t2.tagID = t1.tagID and t2.tsStart = (select max(t3.tsStart) from
#'    tagDeps as t3 where t3.tagID=t2.tagID and t3.tsStart <= t1.ts and
#'    t3.tsEnd >= t1.ts)
#'
#' This will yield NA for the 'info' field when there is no tag
#' deployment covering the range.  Running EXPLAIN on this query in
#' sqlite suggests it optimizes well.
